# RelicRework

This is a mod that rebalances, reworks and tweaks some relics. Most of these changes are to make underwhelming relics more impactful, give some "on pickup" relics passive effects and change some relics that don't work in multiplayer.

| [Ring of the Snake](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Ring_of_the_Snake)           | At the start of each combat, draw 1 additional card and gain 1 Energy.                                                            | Enabled        | The Silent's starting relic is just [Bag of Preperation](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Bag_of_Preparation). Could've changed bag of prep here, but I'd rather other classes have access to it.                                                                                                                                                          |

| [Ceramic Fish](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Ceramic_Fish)                     | Cards and relics at the shop cost 20 less Gold.                                                                                   | Enabled        | Ceramic Fish is bad and kinda boring, this change adds something interesting (flat discounts) without really changing it much. It feels a bit better to see early on and it's now takeable from shops as you only need to buy 7-8 cards/relics which is somewhat reasonable if you see this act 1.                                                               |
| [Juzu Bracelet](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Juzu_Bracelet?so=search)         | CHANGES                                                                                                                           | Disabled       | JUSTIFICATION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [Maw Bank](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Maw_Bank)                             | Whenever you climb a floor, store 12 Gold. Right click to smash open and gain all Gold inside. No longer works once smashed open. | Enabled        | Relics don't usually have downsides, Maw Bank has the downside of making you avoid shops when routing or skip shops entirely when ? rooms have them. This change makes Maw Bank a lot better, as you don't have to avoid these anymore. This is also one of the more multiplayer focused changes, as forcing your entire team to route around shops is annoying. |
| [Strawberry](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Strawberry)                         | Upon pickup, raise your Max HP by 7. At the end of combat, heal 1 HP.                                                             | Enabled        | This falls into the 'granting on pickup relics a passive effect' kind of change. Each fruit has a minor effect to do with healing, with Strawberry here having the worst one.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [Tiny Chest](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Tiny_Chest)                         | Chests in Treasure rooms are more likely to be larger.                                                                            | Disabled       | This is another multiplayer oriented change. Treasure room chest drops are `3:2:1` for `small:medium:large`, this slightly tweaks it to be `1:3:2` for `small:medium:large`.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [Darkstone Periapt](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Darkstone_Periapt?so=search) | Whenever you draw a Curse, draw 1 card.                                                                                           | Enabled        | Darkstone Periapt is very underwhelming,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
